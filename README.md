GlassRoll

Roll dice through Glass!

Forked from [JZPlusPlus](https://github.com/jzplusplus).

Either compile the source or grab the APK [here](https://github.com/Ambergleam/GlassRoll/raw/master/bin/GlassRoll.apk) and install it using ADB.

Then just say "ok glass, roll a die" then followed by "d6" or "d20" or any "d-number" to have it generate a random number between 1 and your die value.

Also, it currently requires an internet connection for the speech to number transcription.
